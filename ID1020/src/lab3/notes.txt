4711 and 4713 are the good choices as they have the least amount of dividers.
This is important because of the way the bucket index is decided, namely with modulus.
If the chosen size has few divisors then there are more possible results of i mod array_size,
and as such you get a more even spread.


ST => get=log(N), put=0.5N
BST => get=1.39log(N), put=1.39log(N)
RBBST => get=log(N), put=log(N)

ST comp BST ~ ST 2x slower
BST comp RBBST ~ BST 1.4x slower
