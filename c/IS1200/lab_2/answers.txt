1)
gv is a gobal variable and as such is changed in "fun". 
m is a local variable and is not a pointer,
so in "fun" "param" is a temporary copy of m that is only used within the scope of the function.

2)
The size of the pointer is the size of an address -> 32bits

3)
The phrase is 8 characters long and a character string ends with a null byte,
so the char array has to have 9 elements (bytes)

4)
They are allocated under the 0x9D000000+ addresses ->
That is the "KSEG0"(cacheable range) Program Flash (Non volatile)
They represent the address where the first instruction of the function is stored?

5)
They are allocated under the 0xA0000000+ addresses ->
That is the "KSEG1"(non-cachable range) Data RAM.

Since they are global values for the whole program to use and manipulate, they are put under the
Data RAM instead of Program RAM.

6)
They are allocated under the (0xA000000 + Program Base Address(4FE0?) ) addresses ->
That is the "KSEG1"(non-cachable range) Program RAM.
Their addresses are bigger becasue they are stored at the DKPBA (Data Kernel Program Base Address),
which is a address added on to the Data RAM address to seperate the two.

7)
Address: A0003FE8
Value: A0003FE4 (m)
Value of pointer address: 7

8)
Address: A0003FE8
Value: A0003FE4 (m)
Value of pointer address: 8

9)
Seems to be big-endian
The value was set to 0x1234abcd but the order of the value in memory is [cd, ab, 34, 12]
